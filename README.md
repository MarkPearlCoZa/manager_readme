Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your on boarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

# My Job

- Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)  
- Set clear context so people in the Future Makers Academy can be successful, connecting the dots between what MYOB needs and what the individual needs (career growth).

I serve you, not the other way around. I'm here to help. Ask me. You work for MYOB, not for me nor any other manager. Optimize for MYOB. 

# On methods of communication 

I like Slack for quick interactions but sometimes I'm busy when a message comes through and I forget to respond so if you have something important and it does not need an immediate response **email me**. If you need an answer to something important or you are sending me important information **email me**. 

I generally respond to emails within 24 hours unless it's a weekend or I'm on leave. If I haven't responded to your email within 24 hours and you need a response don't be shy to send me a poke over Slack or text.  

If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating I will always err on the side of "let's chat face to face", or "let’s hop on a video call" to have a quick chat.

If there is something that needs my immediate attention and I'm not responding on Slack call me (my number is +64 22 161 7226).

# On my schedule 

I am a morning person.  I am usually in the office between 7am and 4pm (New Zealand Time). 

My average day starts with an hour of reading and learning, during this time I find a private space to hide away and be on my own which means I'm around... you just can't see me :-)

I rarely take a lunch break, I prefer to eat and work although I always appreciate invitations to join you for special lunches or just to catch up.

If I'm at my desk you are welcome to come over and interrupt me (I know that if I need some uninterrupted time to move away from my desk into a meeting room). If I'm sitting in an open space it is usually just that I want a change of scenery, feel free to approach/interrupt me in these situations as well.

I work from home once a week on Monday's which I prefer to keep clear from meetings to optimize for deep thinking **however** if you have something that is urgent don't hesitate to reach out to me during this time.

#  Want to talk? Let's talk

I tend to have a lot of things on the go, very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me. 

Feel entirely free to catch up with me ad-hoc via Slack or in person, or put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want. You may not find a slot on my calendar in any given day, if you want to talk let me know via Slack or phone and I'll make some space.  

# One on ones'

I would love to do weekly one-on-ones with all my direct reports but because how the academy is structured and the number of direct reports this is simply not feasible. 

With many of you I will have a one-on-ones once a quarter. I know that isn't ideal. To counter this I've tried to find the best mentors possible for you and I expect you to be having weekly one-on-ones with them, if this isn't happening let me know.

When we have one-on-ones they are for you. I want you to drive the agenda around what's on your mind, what you feel is succeeding, what you are challenged by and above all how I can help you. I'll ask questions to help discover more when we have them.

If you work in the same city as me I prefer to do one-on-ones in person, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one please let me know so we can reschedule it.

If you work in a different city I'm happy to do one-on-ones on video chat. When I travel to your city I will do my best to let everyone know I will be around so that there are opportunities to meet in person. If you know I'm going to be in town and would like to have a one-on-one and I haven't said anything just poke me on Slack and we will set something up.

If you feel we haven't had a one-on-one in a while and you would like one feel free to pop one in my calendar.

At the end of the day one-on-ones are about building relationships on a level beyond simply “what’s going on with your work today”. I’m here to support you and your growth, it’s up to you to let me know how best I can do that.

# My North Star Principles

## Transparency & Candor 

I bias toward transparency and candor. You can ask me anything. Most of the time I'll answer. MYOB rarely requires me to not tell you about something but it cannot require me to lie to you and even if it did I would not abide by such a requirement. I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Feedback

I make mistakes and want to improve just like you which is why I really value all forms of feedback. While I love hearing about the things you liked and would like to see more of, I find it even more useful hearing about the things you didn't like and thought I could do better on. 

I prefer in-person feedback. That allows me to get more context. If you're only comfortable initiating feedback with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not give me feedback at all. If you're not comfortable giving me feedback directly, I'd love for you to give it to someone else (like Chanh) so that she can anonymously relay it to me. 

Similarly, if you have feedback for someone else you work with, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, feel free to relay it to me and I will pass it along. If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## Positive Intent

I always start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved. I believe people usually try to do the right thing given the information they have at that point in time.

## Opinionated

I have opinions. This does not mean they are correct or you should blindly believe them. Please challenge my opinions so that I can learn with you.

## Growth and learning

I optimize for growth and learning which is probably why I got involved in the Future Makers Academy in the first place. I want you to work in a place where you are regularly growing and learning __*even if that place is not here*__. I will do everything I can to help you get into a growth environment. 

# Nuance 

**I am an introvert**. That means if I've been in a large group of people I get exhausted and need some quiet time to recharge. Often a quick walk around the neighborhood is enough. You will often see me walking. I like to walk and chat, feel free to join me for a walk anytime.    

**I hate absolutes**. Always and never are triggers for me. I prefer usually and often.

**I talk to think**. That means sometimes I explore ideas out loud even if they are not fully fleshed out. If I say something that you feel is poorly defined or just doesn't sit well call it out, it helps me think things through better.

**I have a poor short term memory**. Blame it to having 3 young kids and so not getting enough sleep, I'm aware that I have a poor short term memory and sometimes forget things. I'm actively working on it. Be patient with me. 

**I am traditionally a people pleaser**. While I am no longer unable to say "no", I still want to find a way to help others. I try my best to not let this impact my ability to do my job, and more importantly those I work with. If you feel I am "people pleasing" to the greater detriment of others please call me out on it. I have grounded myself over the years so for the most part this is no longer an issue, but it does slip through sometimes.

**I like to great people by name and give them a hand shake**. If that feels awkward I'm up for any sort of variation of a handshake, from fist bump to personalized secret handshake. If you are really not comfortable with the physical contact let me know and I'll revert to a wave. I will do my best to greet you by name everyday, because of the challenges with my short term memory sometimes I may forget your name, if this happens just remind me. Don't feel like I don't care, I've forgotten my sisters name once in front of hundreds of people (ask me and I will tell you about how that happened).

**I hate indifference**. I feel strongly that if I'm in a "system" and I'm not happy with how things are going then I should do everything in my power to change the system or let those know who are able to make changes be aware of what can be improved. I believe working for a company is a system. I know this is not always easy however it's better than just not caring. I hope those I work with do the same.

**I try my best to show up on time and expect you to do the same**. I hate being late for meetings, although sometimes it happens. I will do my very best to be at a meeting before it starts. Sometimes I have back to back meetings which means I need about 5 minutes to get from the one to the other. I will do my utmost to be at meetings on time. I absolutely have the expectation that you will do the same.
