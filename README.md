Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your onboarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

# My Job

- Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)  
- Set context   

# Communication Protocol

I like slack for quick questions but sometimes I miss things or I'm busy when a message comes through and I forget to respond.

If you need an answer to something important or you are sending me important information use email.

# Want to talk? Let's talk

- I usually have a lot of things on the go, very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me.
- Feel entirely free to catch up with me ad-hoc via Slack or in person, or put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want.
  - You may not find a slot on my calendar in any given day  
  - If you want to talk let's talk, let me know via Slack or phone me (+64 22 161 7226) and I'll make some space  

# My North Star Principles

*Honesty*. I will always be honest with you, this is important to me. If there is some information that I have that is confidential, I will tell you that I cannot answer it.

*Feedback*. I value feedback of all forms. Feedback on what I'm doing well is great, but the really useful feedback is the type that shows areas I can improve. If you have a problem with something, or see a better way I can do things let me know. I always value the feedback.

*I assume positive intent*. I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.

*I optimize for growth and learning*.

# Nuance 

*I am an introvert* and that means sometimes I get quiet

*I hate absolutes*. Always and never are triggers for me.

*I talk to think*. That means sometimes I may be exploring an idea outloud and are still in the process of thinking it through. If I say something that you feel is poorly defined call it out, sometimes I don't realise it.
