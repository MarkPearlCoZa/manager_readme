Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your onboarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

My preferences

I like slack for quick questions, but sometimes I miss things. If you need an answer to something rather send it to me in email

I will always be honest with you, I will not lie to you. This is important to me. If there is some information that I have that is confidential, I will tell you that I cannot tell you.
Feedback on areas I can improve is important to me, if you have a problem with something, or see a better way I can do things let me know. I always value the feedback.
People are important to me, I optimize for growth and learning.
