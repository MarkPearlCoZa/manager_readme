Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your onboarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

My preferences

I like slack for quick questions, but sometimes I miss things. If you need an answer to something rather send it to me in email

# My North Star Principles

*Honesty*. I will always be honest with you, this is important to me. If there is some information that I have that is confidential, I will tell you that I cannot answer it.

*Feedback*. I value feedback of all forms. Feedback on what I'm doing well is great, but the really useful feedback is the type that shows areas I can improve. If you have a problem with something, or see a better way I can do things let me know. I always value the feedback.

*I assume positive intent*. I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.

*I optimize for growth and learning*.

# Nuance 

*I am an introvert* and that means sometimes I get quiet

*I hate absolutes*. Always and never are triggers for me.

*I talk to think*. That means sometimes I may be exploring an idea outloud and are still in the process of thinking it through. If I say something that you feel is poorly defined call it out, sometimes I don't realise it.
