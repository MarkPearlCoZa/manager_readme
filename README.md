Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your onboarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

# My Job

- Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)  
- Set context for participants in the Future Makers Academy

I serve you, not the other way around. I'm here to help. Ask me. You work for MYOB, not for me nor any other manager. Optimize for MYOB. 

# On methods of communication 

I like Slack for quick interactions but sometimes I'm busy when a message comes through and I forget to respond. If it's important and it does not need an immediate response email me. If you need an answer to something important or you are sending me important information... you guessed it... email me. If it is something that needs immediate attention call me (my number is +64 22 161 7226).

# Want to talk? Let's talk

- I usually have a lot of things on the go, very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me.

- Feel entirely free to catch up with me ad-hoc via Slack or in person, or put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want. You may not find a slot on my calendar in any given day, if you want to talk let's talk just let me know via Slack or phone me and I'll make some space.  

# My North Star Principles

## Transparency & Candor 

I bias toward transparency and candor. You can ask me anything. Most of the time I'll answer. MYOB may rarely require me to not tell you about something but it cannot require me to lie to you and even if it did I would not abide by such a requirement. I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Feedback

I'm make mistakes and want to improve just like you which is why I embrace all forms of feedback. While I like to hear about the things you liked and would like to see more of, I find it even more useful hearing about the things you didn't like and thought I could do better on.

I prefer in-person feedback. That allows me to get more context. If you're only comfortable initiating feedback with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all. If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback directly, I'd love for you to give it to someone else (like Chanh) so that she can anonymously relay it to me. 

Similarly, if you have feedback for someone else you work with, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, feel free to relay it to me and I will pass it along. If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## Positive Intent

I always start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.

## Growth and learning

I optimize for growth and learning which is probably why I got involved in the Future Makers Academy in the first place. I want you to work in a place where you are reguarly growing and learning.

# Nuance 

*I am an introvert* and that means sometimes I get quiet

*I hate absolutes*. Always and never are triggers for me.

*I talk to think*. That means sometimes I may be exploring an idea outloud and are still in the process of thinking it through. If I say something that you feel is poorly defined call it out, sometimes I don't realise it.
