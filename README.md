Hi, welcome to my "manager" readme. 

I'm writing this readme as an experiment to see if it helps you work with me better as well as to make your onboarding smoother. This document will evolve as I evolve.

# My Job

- Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)  
- Set context for participants in the Future Makers Academy

I serve you, not the other way around. I'm here to help. Ask me. You work for MYOB, not for me nor any other manager. Optimize for MYOB. 

# On methods of communication 

I like Slack for quick interactions but sometimes I'm busy when a message comes through and I forget to respond. 

If it's important and it does not need an immediate response **email me**. If you need an answer to something important or you are sending me important information **email me**. 

I generally respond to emails within 24 hours unless it's a weekend or I'm on leave. If I haven't responded to your email within 24 hours and you need a response don't be shy to send me a poke over Slack or text.  

If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating I will always err on the side of "let's chat face to face", or if we are not physically co-located then "let’s hop on a video call" to have a quick chat.

If there is something that needs my immediate attention and I'm not responding on Slack call me (my number is +64 22 161 7226).

# On my schedule 

I am a morning person.  I am usually in the office between 7am and 4pm (New Zealand Time). 

My average day starts with an hour of reading and learning, during this time I find a private space to hide away and be on my own which means I'm around... you just can't see me :-)

I rarely take a lunch break, I prefer to eat and work although I always appreciate invitations to join you for special lunches or just to catch up.

If I'm at my desk you are welcome to come over and interrupt me (I know that if I need some uninterupted time to move away from my desk).  

I work from home once a week on Monday's which I prefer to keep clear from meetings to optimize for deep thinking **however** if you have something that is urgent don't hesitate to reach out to me during this time.

#  Want to talk? Let's talk

I tend to have a lot of things on the go, very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me. 

Feel entirely free to catch up with me ad-hoc via Slack or in person, or put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want. You may not find a slot on my calendar in any given day, if you want to talk let me know via Slack or phone me and I'll make some space.  

# One on ones'

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please let me know so I can reschedule it, or reschedule it yourself during an open slot in my calendar.

# My North Star Principles

## Transparency & Candor 

I bias toward transparency and candor. You can ask me anything. Most of the time I'll answer. MYOB rarely requires me to not tell you about something but it cannot require me to lie to you and even if it did I would not abide by such a requirement. I'm committed to never lying to you.

## Feedback

I'm make mistakes and want to improve just like you which is why I embrace all forms of feedback. While I like to hear about the things you liked and would like to see more of, I find it even more useful hearing about the things you didn't like and thought I could do better on.

I prefer in-person feedback. That allows me to get more context. If you're only comfortable initiating feedback with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all. If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback directly, I'd love for you to give it to someone else (like Chanh) so that she can anonymously relay it to me. 

Similarly, if you have feedback for someone else you work with, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, feel free to relay it to me and I will pass it along. If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## Positive Intent

I always start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved. I believe people usually try to do the right thing given the information they have at that point in time.

## Growth and learning

I optimize for growth and learning which is probably why I got involved in the Future Makers Academy in the first place. I want you to work in a place where you are reguarly growing and learning.

# Nuance 

**I am an introvert**. That means if I've been in a large group of people I get exhausted and need some quiet time to recharge. Often a quick walk around the neighborhood does is enough.  

**I hate absolutes**. Always and never are triggers for me. I prefer usually and often.

**I talk to think**. That means sometimes I explore ideas outloud. Often when I'm dong this I am still in the process of thinking things through. If I say something that you feel is poorly defined call it out, it helps me think it through better.

**I have a poor short term memory**. Blame it to having 3 young kids and so not gettting enough sleep, I'm aware that I have a poor short term memory and sometimes forget the things. I'm actively working on it. Be patient with me. 

**I like to great people by name and give them a hand shake**. Call me old fashioned, I greet people with handshakes. If that feels awkward I'm up for any sort of variation, from fist bump to personalized hanshake. If you are really not comfortable with the physical contact let me know and I'll revert to a wave.
